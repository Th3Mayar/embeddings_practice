Here's a description for your repository `embeddings_practice`:

---

# embeddings_practice

This repository contains practical exercises on the generation, visualization, and application of word embeddings. The exercises demonstrate how to create embeddings using popular models like Word2Vec and BERT, visualize these embeddings using PCA and Matplotlib, and implement a simple semantic search system.

## Contents

- **Theory of Embeddings**: An introduction to what embeddings are, their importance, and different types of embeddings.
- **Generation of Embeddings**:
  - Using Word2Vec with Gensim
  - Using BERT with Transformers
- **Visualization of Embeddings**: Reducing dimensionality with PCA and visualizing embeddings with Matplotlib.
- **Practical Applications**:
  - Semantic Search
  - Text Classification (future expansion)

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you need to install the following libraries:

```sh
pip install gensim spacy transformers matplotlib seaborn sklearn
```

## Usage

Clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook `embeddings_practice.ipynb` to go through the practical exercises.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/embeddings_practice.git
cd embeddings_practice
```

Open the notebook with Jupyter or any compatible environment:

```sh
jupyter notebook embeddings_practice.ipynb
```
